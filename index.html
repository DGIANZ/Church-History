          <h3>Apostolic Fathers & Apologists Arise</h3>
          <p>The Second Century saw the rise of the Apostolic Fathers and Apologists. With the death of the Apostle John, early Christians lost their ability to seek out eyewitnesses to settle disputes. Thus, the Apostolic Fathers rose to prominence. These men were disciples of eyewitnesses of Jesus Christ or the disciple of a disciple who was discipled by an eyewitness and thus regarded as authoritative. Examples include Clement of Rome, Polycarp of Smyrna, and Ignatius of Antioch. Authoritative writings of this period are also referred to as Apostolic Fathers because of their influence among Christians during this period. Examples are The Didache, Epistle of Barnabas, Shepherd of Hermas, etc.</p>
          <p>The apologists emerged as defenders of Christianity against misunderstandings and persecution. They began using Greek philosophy to defend the Gospel, making it appear rational. Examples include Aristides, Justin Martyr, Melito of Sardis, Athenagoras of Athens, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch. These men utilized Greek philosophy and reason to reach the Romans. Their contributions led Christianity to become mainstream rather than fading into a folk religion. Nevertheless, some early Christians opposed such use of Greek philosophy, fearing that it would corrupt the message of salvation.</p>

          <h3>Second Century Heresies</h3>
          <p>The second century saw the emergence of Gnosticism and Montanism. The Gnostics taught that the cosmos is incurable and, therefore, must be rejected.  Thus, all forms of matter were considered evil, and salvation consisted of escaping the bondage of physical substance. They taught that special knowledge existed and could only be obtained by a select elite. While proclaiming to be Christians, Gnostics denied that God became incarnate, died, and raised again; Jesus, according to the Gnostics, did not appear in the flesh but rather as a spirit who looked as if He was in a human body.</p>
          <p>Montanus, a self-proclaimed Christian prophet, began teaching that he was the mouthpiece of the Holy Spirit. He felt that spirituality was decreasing in the Church, so he started his own congregations.  He placed great emphasis on signs and wonders. He was excommunicated from the Church, and the sect he founded, Montanism, was condemned heretical.</p>

          <h3>Birth of St. Irenaeus of Lyons</h3>
          <p>Saint Irenaeus of Lyons is born near Smyrna. St. Irenaeus was a disciple of Polycarp. He was the first to write a sustained criticism of Gnosticism and became instrumental in refuting it. His work included five volumes “Against Heresies.” Irenaeus also developed the concept of writing an introduction to theology for the laity. He was also the first Christian thinker to deal with the doctrines of sin and redemption in depth. Irenaeus proposed the Theory of Recapitulation, which taught that Jesus was a “new head” for Christianity, just as Adam had been. Thus, all humanity is capable of being saved. Moreover, the theory emphasized the importance of Jesus’ life in its entirety, including His Incarnation, rather than His death alone. This theory became the base for Orthodox theology. Irenaeus also believed in Theosis or Divinization, which is the act of becoming more like God. He thought that the goal of history was for mankind to dwell in unity with God. In turn, his view of Satan was that Satan became jealous of this high view of humanity and thus tempted Adam and Eve. Additionally, Irenaeus believed that God’s desire for humanity would have led to Jesus’ Incarnation even if sin had not entered the world. The Fall only necessitated the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ. All in all, St. Irenaeus of Lyons is often regarded as the first true theologian of Christianity.</p>

          <h3>Birth of Origen</h3>
          <p>Origen of Alexandria is born in Alexandria, Egypt. Origen was likely taught at the Alexandrian catechetical school and probably received instruction from Clement of Alexandria. Origen became the principal of the school at the age of 18, his genius noticed by many. He possessed a prolific writing career.  He was not afraid of Greek philosophy and utilized it in defending Christianity.
            One of Origen’s compositions is “Contra Celsum,” a work that refutes Celsus’ refutation of Christianity. In writing this work, Origen defeated a massive threat to the credibility of Christianity. He was a speculative thinker and saw three levels of meaning in Scripture: corporeal, soulish, and spiritual. Needless to say, Origen, consistent with Alexandrian thought, embraced an allegorical interpretation of Scripture. His doctrine of God involved the view that God is perfect and cannot change. Thus, Origen believed that God didn’t change even during the Incarnation of Jesus.
            Nevertheless, Origen was not without criticism. He was accused of embracing heresy and being an influencer of every heresy that came after him. He was posthumously condemned in 553 AD.

          <p>Emperor Decius, perceiving a lack of unity of religion, began a holy war against those who refused to bow to the gods of Rome’s pagan past. He ordered people to make sacrifices and obtain certificates. Without a certificate, there was no protection. Some Christians obeyed the edict, some refused, some recanted under torture, and some refused even under torture. Those who survived the torture became known as “the confessors.”</p>

          <h3>Third Century Centers</h3>
          <p>As the Church became more structured and theology formalized, two great centers of Christian thought emerged: Carthage (West) and Alexandria (East). Those in Carthage were more focused on practicality and desired to develop a sound system of church life. Thinkers include Cyprian and Tertullian. Those in Alexandria were more interested in using Platonic philosophy to communicate the Gospel to a broad audience. They wanted to demonstrate that Christianity was the Absolute Truth that philosophers sought. Thinkers in Alexandria include Clement and Origen.</p>
          <p>Clement of Alexandria followed the motto, “All truth is God’s truth wherever it may be found.” He produced “Exhortation to the Heathen,” a polemic against paganism. In the composition, he suggested that some of the thoughts of Socrates and Plato came from Moses. He also wrote “The Stromata,” which was an attempt to create a comprehensive Christian philosophy. Clement appeared to embrace some Gnostic thought in that he treated the body and matter as “lower nature” in contrast to the soul. He also believed that God was passionless and without emotion, a standard for which Christians should aim.</p>
          <p>Tertullian eschewed Greek philosophy, fearing that it would corrupt the message of salvation. He taught a blind faith, a teaching that emphasized that all speculation outside of Divine Revelation, including apostolic writings, is useless. Tertullian fought against the heresy of Marcion, who had developed his own biblical canon that excluded anything Jewish, and against Praxeas, who developed a heresy later known as Sabellianism.</p>

          <h3>Birth of St. Cyprian of Carthage</h3>
          <p>Saint Cyprian of Carthage is born into a wealthy pagan family in Carthage. 
            Cyprian received the best education possible and managed his family’s vast estates. He was afforded a life of luxury. However, he converted to Christianity at the age of 40 and began distributing his wealth to the poor. The love he garnered by the people led to a swift ordination.
          </p>
          <p>Cyprian faced a challenging issue within the early Church. Believers who had lapsed under Emperor Decius’ edict sought readmission to the Church. The Confessors, those who had withstood torture and remained faithful to the Church, readmitted them of their own accord. However, Cyprian believed that readmission required oversight and that it was the duty of ordained bishops to readmit apostates. Cyprian insisted that they must make proper repentance and penance. Moreover, Novatian, who later declared himself bishop, thought that none of the apostates should be readmitted.</p>
          <p>Cyprian’s view of the role of bishops evolved into the spiritual hierarchy of the East and West. He believed in apostolic succession and the necessity of the Church for salvation. He saw the Church as the “indispensable ark of salvation.” He also believed that the process of salvation began at baptism and that baptism may only be performed by an authorized bishop or their representative.</p>

          <h3>Fourth Century Developments</h3>
          <p>In the fourth century, the Church saw a formalization of hierarchical organizational structure, the formulation of creeds, and the identification of a canon of Christian Scriptures. Persecutions against Christians also began to subside.  The world sees the first “Christian” emperor in Emperor Constantine. Christianity became a part of “Roman pop-culture.”</p>
          <p>Athanasius composes “On the Incarnation of the Word,” stressing the importance of the Incarnation and “Against the Arians,” which was a polemic against the Arian heresy. The Cappadocian Fathers built on his work, defending Trinitarian doctrine and taught that God was one “ousia” (substance) and three hypostases (persons). They also maintained the full deity of the Son along with His distinction from the Father, refuting Arianism and Eunomianism, an extreme form of Arianism. Thinkers of this group include Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa.</p>
          <p>See “Birth of Basil of Caesarea” and “Birth of Gregory of Nazianzus” for an overview of their contributions.</p>
          <p>Gregory of Nyssa lacked the prestigious education of the other two, yet he is likely the most accomplished theologian of the three. He took over the mantle of theological leadership after the death of Basil. He emphasized God’s mystery and incomprehensibility and defined evil as the privation of goodness. He also taught the concept of instantiation, using gold coins as an example. He promoted a way of theological thinking known as “Via Negativa,” which described God based on what He is not.</p>
          <p>This century also saw the rise of John Chrysostom, a popular early Church Father.</p>

          <h3>Fourth Century Heresies</h3>
          <p>The Church in the fourth century experienced the rising of threats from within. Arius of Alexandria taught that Jesus was not eternal and was created. He developed the motto, “there was when the Son was not.” Arius studied under Lucian, who was a disciple of Paul of Samosata. Arius couldn’t openly teach adoptionism, so he developed a subtler form.  He denied the absolute divinity of Jesus because he believed that Jesus’ life as a human would have brought change to God and that if Jesus was God, then God would have suffered in Him on the Cross. These two concepts were inconceivable to Arius. One key thought of Arianism is that God is by nature removed from creatureliness and that Jesus Christ must be a creature if the Logos became human in Him. Another key thought was that salvation involved freely choosing to submit to God and be joined with Him. If Jesus, as the example of such submission, was God, we cannot replicate His example. The Arian Controversy caused such an uproar among early Christianity that Emperor Constantine called a council to settle the dispute. Later, an extreme form of Arianism known as Eunomianism emerged.</p>
          <p>Saint Athanasius of Alexandria was a fierce opponent of Arius. He defended the deity of Christ, refusing to accept anything less than the recognition of Christ as God. He believed that any alterations to such a belief threatened salvation.</p>

          <p>Constantine attacks Rome and becomes the emperor. His appeal to any god to help him led to a vision of a cross. He later made the Edict of Milan, which ended persecution for Christians. He gradually began favoring Christian over other religions and went on to see himself as a “bishop of bishops” or the “thirteenth apostle.”</p>

          <p>Emperor Constantine initiates a council to settle the Arian Controversy. All bishops are invited, of which about 318 of them attend. Various issues are dealt with, but the big issue revolved around Arius’ teaching. Eusebius of Nicomedia reads a statement denying the deity of Christ, causing an uproar. Constantine intervened to quell the crowd. Constantine, likely under advice from an advisor, recommends using the word “homoousios,” which means “one substance” or “one being” to describe Christ’s relationship with the Father. Most of the bishops agreed. The Nicene Creed was formed, effectively “putting flesh on the skeleton” of the Apostles’ Creed. Eusebius of Nicomedia and Theognis of Nicaea refused to sign the creed, making it clear that the controversy was not over. Nevertheless, Arius was deposed, condemned as a heretic, and exiled.</p>

          <p>Basil of Caesarea is born into a wealthy family. His sister, Macrina, influenced him and his brother, Gregory of Nyssa, spiritually. He attended the best school for Greek culture and philosophy in Athens, where he met Gregory of Nazianzus. He later renounced his family’s wealth, forfeited his legacy as the eldest son, and founded a monastery.</p>
          <p>Basil fought against the pneumatomachians, who taught that the Holy Spirit was not divine and was inferior to the Father and Son. He wrote “On the Holy Spirit,” fearing that the Holy Spirit was forgotten about amongst the debate of the person and deity of Christ.</p>

He taught that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not three independent beings or actions, but rather three interdependent relations living in community.</p>
          <p>Gregory was later made Patriarch of Constantinople by Emperor Theodosius, who recognized his ability. Thus, he became a presiding officer over the Council of Constantinople in 381.</p>

          <h3>Birth of St. Augustine of Hippo</h3>
          <p>Saint Augustine of Hippo is born in a small city in North Africa to a Christian mother and pagan father. He credits his mother for his eventual repentance because of her prayers for him.</p>
          <p>Augustine marked the end of the early Church and the beginning of the medieval Church theologically. He taught the absolute Sovereignty of God and the human soul’s complete dependence on Him for salvation. He was not the first to propose such an idea, but he put a new spin on it. His teaching is referred to as monergism and holds that the human soul is entirely passive in salvation and that God is the agent responsible for all history and individual salvation. This contradicted the theological belief in synergism, which held that human and divine agency cooperate to produce history and salvation. In other words, Augustine didn’t believe in free will.</p>
          <p>Augustine also battled Manicheanism, a type of Gnosticism that taught that the stars controlled human actions and destinies.</p>
          <p>Moreover, Saint Augustine battled Pelagius, who taught that humans could choose to live righteously and move toward God before being seized by God’s transforming grace. Augustine held to the view that an individual must be seized by grace to change and obtain salvation.  His position led to the formation of his concept of predestination. He also formulated the doctrine of Original sin, which highlighted that sin exists within an individual, as can be seen by selfishness in infants.</p>

          <h3>Issues in the Fifth Century</h3>
          <p>After the issue of the deity of Christ was settled, a new problem emerged. If God is eternal and cannot change, how did He pull off the Incarnation? Two competing camps emerged. While both camps presupposed God’s immutability and impassibility, they emphasized different aspects of the Incarnation. Alexandria, concerned with true divinity touching humanity to heal it, proposed that the Logos replaced the rational human will in Jesus. The result was a human Logos without a full human will. In the fourth century, Apollinarius, carrying to its conclusion the theology of former Alexandrian heroes, developed a view that can be described as “God in a bod.” Eutyches taught that the Logos absorbed the human nature of Christ. Additionally, Monophysitism taught that Christ had only one nature. They were unwilling to accept an impersonal human nature of Christ. Antioch, in contrast, held that Jesus had a full human will. For Christians to become like Christ, according to Antioch, Jesus had to have a human will. Moreover, Christ had to possess a human will in order to redeem it. Otherwise, Jesus could not redeem the fallen nature of mankind. Theodore Of Mopsuestia taught a dualistic Christology. He taught that the Logos could not be in a natural union with the human body of Jesus Christ. Thus, the Son of God was in a union with a human body in which the human changed, but the Son of God did not. However, the humanity of Jesus was necessary because, without it, Jesus’ union with God would be impossible for Christians to replicate. His union would be static and automatic rather than through free will. Theodore’s dualistic Christology embraced languaged that suggested adoptionism. He taught that the human person Jesus and the Son of God cooperated so closely together that it was impossible to separate their activity. Nestorius taught that the Logos indwelt the person of Jesus. Thus, the union was merely mechanical rather than organic. The debate was complex and, as can be predicted, led to councils and synods to resolve the issue.</p>

          <h3>Death of Maximus the Confessor</h3>
          <p>Maximus the Confessor is tortured to death after openly denouncing the emperor’s influence over Church and theology. Maximus refused to accept Monothelitism, which held that although Jesus had two natures and was one person, He only had one will. If such were true, it would have certainly been His divine will. However, if Jesus did not possess a human will, then He could not have healed it.</p>

          <p>Bishops gathered and condemned the iconoclasts. The council concluded that holy images (icons) were not idols and were to be venerated. It was held that there was a difference between worship and veneration. This settled the dispute between John of Damascus and Iconoclasm.</p>

          <p>A synod of bishops meet in Germany and declare those who do not accept the addition of “and the Son” in the Nicene Creed to be heretical. The pope rejected the extreme measure, seeking to prevent a schism between the East and West. However, the damage was done, and the Church was one step closer to the Great Schism in 1054.</p>

          <h3>The Great Schism</h3>
          <p>A papal bull is delivered to the Great Church of the Holy Wisdom, excommunicating the patriarch of Constantinople and his associates. The culmination of differences, a lack of communication, and too much institutionalism rather than movement divided Christendom. The Church has never been unified since. While cultural differences most likely played a factor in the separation, both sides point to papal authority, the authoritative status of the bishop of Rome, and the issue of Filioque, the addition of “and the Son” into the Nicene Creed.</p>
